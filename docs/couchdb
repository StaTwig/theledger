Migrating from MongoDB to CouchDB using Mongoose involves a few steps. Here's a general outline of the process:

1. Update Mongoose Connection. For example:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to CouchDB
mongoose.connect('http://localhost:5984/mydatabase', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
```

2. Define CouchDB Schemas: CouchDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database, similar to MongoDB. However, it uses a different schemaless approach. You'll need to redefine your Mongoose schemas to fit CouchDB's document structure. Remove any schema validations that are specific to MongoDB and modify your schema definitions accordingly.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define CouchDB schema
const mySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // Define your schema fields here
  // ...
});

// Create a CouchDB model
const MyModel = mongoose.model('MyModel', mySchema);
```

3. Adjust Queries and Operations: CouchDB uses a different query syntax compared to MongoDB. You'll need to update your queries and operations to work with CouchDB's query language, which is based on JavaScript functions known as "MapReduce" or "Mango queries." Refer to the CouchDB documentation for details on how to write queries and perform CRUD operations.

4. Migrate Data: Once you have updated your schemas and queries, you can start migrating your data from MongoDB to CouchDB with following link https://www.couchbase.com/blog/migrating-data-from-mongodb-to-couchbase/

5. Test and Verify: After the migration is complete, thoroughly test your application to ensure that everything is functioning as expected. Verify that the data in CouchDB matches the data in MongoDB and that your application's functionality is unaffected by the migration.
